# Classes

Classes can be used to encapsulate data and code.

They act as templates for object instances.

Class members include:
- Properties
- Constructor
- Functions

Multiple instances of an object can be created using the "new" keyword.

## Properties/fields
TS config strict - need to use default values, empty strings, so they're not undefined at run time.

N id: number;

Y id = 0;
## Constructor
Allows to pass in initialization data

Auto implemented properties: Properties autogenerated by typescript. It generates AND assigns the incoming value to the constructor to that property. No need to define properties/fields above.

"Public": Add it for the consumer (outside) of FoodProduct to build, use and pass in id, name and icon.

"Private": If a property can ba passed in but it cannot be accessed, it needs to be private. Private to this class.

## Classes can be extended, marked as abstract, and can implement one or more interfaces.
### extends
Derived (child) classes
If derived classes have a contructor we get an error.

You have to contain a "super" call.
The parent is the super.

You need to call it's constructor

### abstract
Abstract keyword tells typescript that it is a building block class. You can't create an instance of it, can't new it up.

### implements
Applies the interface contract to a class. Helps drive consistency, and prevent build errors.
